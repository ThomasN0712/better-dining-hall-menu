Here’s a refined list of your potential SpaceX interview questions with concise answers:

### **Python & Data Structures**

1. **What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?**  
   A list is mutable (can be changed), whereas a tuple is immutable (cannot be changed). Lists have more overhead, while tuples are slightly faster.

2. **What are hash tables?**  
   A data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function for fast lookup, insertion, and deletion.

3. **How do you deal with conflicts in a hash table?**  
   Common methods include **chaining** (linked list at each bucket) and **open addressing** (probing for the next available slot).

4. **How do you resize a hash table?**  
   Typically, double the size and rehash all existing elements to new buckets.

5. **How does a hash table look in memory?**  
   An array where each index stores key-value pairs or pointers to linked lists (for handling collisions).

### **Algorithms & Complexity**

6. **What is Big O notation?**  
   A way to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's time or space complexity as input size grows.

7. **What is the runtime of inserting an element at the end of a dynamic array?**  
   **Amortized O(1)** (most inserts are O(1), but resizing takes O(n)).

8. **What is the runtime of inserting an element in the middle of a dynamic array?**  
   **O(n)** (shifts elements to maintain order).

9. **What is the runtime of inserting an element in the correct place in a sorted linked list?**  
   **O(n)** for a singly linked list, **O(1)** if already at the right position in a doubly linked list.

10. **What is the worst-case runtime of quicksort?**  
    **O(n²)** (when the pivot consistently results in unbalanced partitions).

### **General CS Concepts**

11. **What is the C `register` keyword for?**  
    A storage class hinting the compiler to store the variable in a CPU register for faster access (modern compilers optimize this automatically).

12. **Basic search algorithm and network concepts?**  
    Search: **Binary search (O(log n)), Linear search (O(n))**.  
    Network: **TCP vs. UDP, IP addressing, DNS, routing, etc.**

### **Behavioral & Experience-Based Questions**

13. **Tell us about a project you are passionate about.**  
    (Tailor an answer to one of your key projects, emphasizing impact and challenges solved.)

14. **Describe a technical challenge you’ve worked on and how it was deployed.**  
    (Discuss a project where you solved a tough issue and implemented it successfully.)

15. **Tell me about yourself.**  
    A **1-2 minute pitch** covering your background, key skills, and why you’re excited about this role.

16. **Why SpaceX?**  
    (Show genuine enthusiasm—mention SpaceX’s mission, cutting-edge technology, and how your skills align.)

17. **We hire the top tenth of the top 1% of engineers. What are you the top tenth of the top one percent at?**  
    (Highlight a unique strength—problem-solving, debugging, speed in learning, or deep expertise in a key area.)

Would you like me to help structure some of your behavioral responses?
